# listify
Listify is a web application which allows you to create and manage all your lists in a single place.

It allows you to create grocery lists, To-Do lists, packing lists, or any other type of list you can think of.
You can add, edit, and delete items from your lists. Listify also provides the functionality of “crossing off” items in the list.
Additionally, Listify allows the user to customize the theme of their account (found in the “Settings" page).

The web application can be found at this link:
